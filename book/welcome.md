## Workshop content

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce a number of the techniques and concepts that professional software developers use to manage their code, projects and teams. Although the development of research codes and software has different needs and challenges to the development of commercial software, there are nonetheless some tools and techniques that we can adopt or adopt to improve our Research Software Engineering. This isn’t a programming workshop, so it will be relevant to you whichever programming language (on Windows, Linux or Mac) or infrastructure (HPC, Cloud, Desktop) you use. This will be a hands-on session with lots of discussion and small group activities. We’ll be joined by a number of people who develop codes and software who will share their experiences.

At the end of the workshop, attendees will be able to:

- Understand the basics stages of Software Development Life Cycle
- How to layout a project
- How to using tools to optimise the work
- How to integrate the work with GitHub
- How to build a testing unit
- How to build a code documentation?

## Delivering Plan

- `Software Development Life Cycle` introduction using quarto slides
- Install Requirements (maybe ask this before)
- Start project and present all content available in this course in a practical example.
