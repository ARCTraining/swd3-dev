# Project management methodologies

## Why choose a project management  methodology?

> Without a design approach, programmers resort to designing as we go, typing in
> code, trying what works, and making it up as we go along. When trying to
> collaborate to make software with others this can result in lots of wasted
> time, software that only the author understands, components built by
> colleagues that don’t work together, or code that the programmer thinks is
> nice but that doesn’t meet the user’s requirements.

## Traditional versus Agile

> The traditional approach (Waterfall) argues that the elements of design should
> occur in order: first requirements capture, then functional design, then
> architectural design. This approach is based on the idea that if a mistake is
> made in the design, then programming effort is wasted, so **significant effort
> is spent in trying to ensure that requirements are well understood and that
> the design is correct before programming starts**.

> Agile project management is an iterative approach to delivering a project
> throughout its life cycle. Iterative or agile life cycles are composed of
> several iterations or incremental steps towards the completion of a project.
> Iterative approaches are frequently used in software development projects to
> promote velocity and adaptability since the benefit of iteration is that you
> can adjust as you go along rather than following a linear path. One of the
> aims of an agile or iterative approach is to release benefits throughout the
> process rather than only at the end.

## The Agile Manifesto

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping
> others do it.

The Agile principles:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

\- [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/)

```{admonition} Agile is not absence of methodology
:class: warning
The Agile movement is not anti-methodology, in fact, many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology. We want to restore a balance. We embrace modelling, but not in order to file some diagram in a dusty corporate repository. We embrace documentation, but not hundreds of pages of never-maintained and rarely-used tomes. We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment.

## Elements of an Agile Process

- Ongoing design
- Iterative development
- Continuous delivery
- Self-organising teams

## Agile methodologies

There are several methodologies that can be used to manage an agile project,
including:

- DAD (disciplined agile delivery)
- DSDM (dynamic systems development method)
- Kanban
- Lean
- LeSS (large-scale Scrum)
- RAD (rapid application development)
- SAFe (scaled agile framework enterprise)
- Scaled agile
- Scrum
- Scrum of scrums
- XP (eXtreme Programming)
